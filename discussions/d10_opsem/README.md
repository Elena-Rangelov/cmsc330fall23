## Operational Semantics

The whole idea behind "operational semantics" is trying to _systematically_ understand how programs evaluate parsed expressions or statements. In other words, we want to be able to **prove** that our programs do indeed work correctly. We do this through the use of axioms and hypotheses to draw conclusions.
